<p>I believe in the power of hands-on experience, and my portfolio reflects my 
    commitment to practical learning. Every line of code, every design decision, 
    and every optimization has been meticulously crafted to showcase not only my

<h3><b>Random Number Generator</b></h3>
<p>Just feed the application a number range and it will pick a number for you. 
    Great for lottery numbers, chores on your to-do-list, even, what to 
    have for dinner. What fun can be had with the random number generator... </p>
