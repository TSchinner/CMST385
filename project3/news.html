<p class="leftmarg">The unofficial break-up of the Beatles happened in 1970 when the debut album of Paul's new 
    band was released, Wings, WildLife. But it took until December 1974 for John Lennon to sign the 
    court documents that officially disbanded the Beatles. All four group members went on to 
    successful solo careers.</p>

<p class="leftmarg">In December 1980, John Lennon was gunned down by a disturbed fan in front of his apartment 
    building in New York City. This event, supposedly, ended all hope of the original four 
    Beatles getting back together to make more music. But in 1995 the three remaining members of 
    the band got together with 3 demo tapes John recorded before his death and created 2 new songs. 
    "Free as a Bird" and "Real Love" were released as part of a three, double album, anthology, 
    featuring the music of recording sessions throughout the member's time as Beatles in 
    the '60s</p>    

<p class="leftmarg">In November 2001, George Harrison lost his battle with lung cancer and passed away at the 
    age of 58. This left Paul and Ringo as the last two surviving Beatles. In, 2002, they both 
    reentered the studio armed with the last demo of a song John recorded before he died, 
    recordings of the work George did on John's demo song in 1995, during their Anthology 
    sessions, and the hope that artificial intelligence could isolate John's voice on his demo 
    song so it could be used to recreate one last Beatles song.</p>
